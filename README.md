# Advent of Code

This is a collection of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) solutions in
the current version of Swift at the time of writing. 

My own puzzle inputs are supplied either as files or constants in the code.

XCTest asserts are used to validate algorithms against puzzle examples.
